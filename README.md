## 🧐 About

The **Breast Cancer Prediction Project — DEPI** is an end-to-end pipeline to classify and analyze breast cancer cases using machine learning. It covers data pre-processing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and explainability. The goal is to provide an interpretable, robust, and reproducible approach for breast cancer detection.

## ✨ Features

- Data cleaning, preprocessing & feature transformations  
- Multiple classification models (e.g. logistic regression, random forest, etc.)  
- Model evaluation (accuracy, ROC, confusion matrix, etc.)  
- Explainability / interpretability (feature importance, SHAP, etc.)  
- Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis  
- Versioning of datasets and model artifacts  

---

## 📂 Dataset

- The raw data (or source) is contained in the `Dataset Versions` folder  
- Used preprocessing scripts to ensure data quality and consistency  
- Train / validation / test splits handled appropriately
