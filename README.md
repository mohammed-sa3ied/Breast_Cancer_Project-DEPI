# 🎗️ Breast Cancer Prediction Project — DEPI

> A machine learning pipeline for breast cancer diagnosis and analysis

---

## 🧐 About

The **Breast Cancer Prediction Project — DEPI** is an end-to-end pipeline to classify and analyze breast cancer cases using machine learning. It covers data pre-processing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and explainability. The goal is to provide an interpretable, robust, and reproducible approach for breast cancer detection.

## ✨ Features

- Data cleaning, preprocessing & visualization
- Multiple classification models (e.g. logistic regression, decision tree, etc.)  
- Model evaluation (accuracy, f1-score, confusion matrix, etc.)  
- Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis  
- Versioning of datasets and model artifacts  

---

## 📂 Dataset

- The raw data (or source) is contained in the `Dataset Versions` folder  
- Used preprocessing scripts to ensure data quality and consistency  
- Train / validation / test splits handled appropriately  

---

## 🗂️ Project Structure

- **Best Model/**: holds final model weights, pickled objects  
- **Notebooks/**: exploratory data analysis, experiments, comparisons  
- **Reports/**: ydata profiling pdf for the dataset
- **Dataset Versions/**: versioned data sets used in each step

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohammed-sa3ied/Breast_Cancer_Project-DEPI.git
   cd Breast_Cancer_Project-DEPI

   ## 🚀 Usage

- Open the notebooks step-by-step in `Notebooks/` to follow the workflow  
- Run the preprocessing and training scripts to reproduce results  
- Use the saved model in `Best Model/` to make predictions on new samples  
- Generate evaluation metrics and visualizations via the report scripts  

---

## 📈 Model Training & Evaluation

- Train multiple classifiers and compare performance  
- Use cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and early stopping  
- Evaluate using metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, AUC  
- Use explainability tools (SHAP, feature importance) to interpret results  

---

## 📊 Results & Visualizations

- Confusion matrices, f1-scores, precision-recall curves  
- Save high-quality figures in `Reports/` for ready presentation
